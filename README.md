## Overview

VIP Ticket Prioritizer is an AI-powered Service Desk system designed to automatically identify, analyze, prioritize, and escalate support tickets raised by high-value employees such as CEOs, Directors, and Managers.

The system combines Rule-Based Prioritization, AI Ticket Analysis, and Real-Time Discord Notifications to help IT support teams respond faster to critical incidents.
